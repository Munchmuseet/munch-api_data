# munch-api_data
This repository contains the data needed to build the [munch-api](https://github.com/Munchmuseet/munch-api).

## About Copyright and Usage
If you wish to use any of the Munchmuseet’s material in a publication (in either printed or digital form), we advise you to first read this page and then contact us. In general you are free to use material from this repository for private, non-commercial purposes. All other use should be agreed upon in writing with Munchmuseet.

When referring to a quotation from the texts in the repository, the following resource reference form should be used:
> “Inventory number, institution, date. Object category + the recipient’s name if applicable (date when the website was visited)”

As in the following examples
> MM N 737, Munchmuseet. Dated 08.01.1889. Letter to Karen Bjølstad (2012-08-29)

> MM T 2734, Munchmuseet. Dated 1909–1911. Sketchbook (2012-08-29)

Reference to a page or folio should use the facsimile’s file name without the file extension (e.g. No-MM_N0737-01) as it gives a unique identification of the page/folio. This can be found in the `xml:id` attribute in the header of the xml file: `<TEI xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" version="5.0" xml:id="No-MM_N0001-01">`.

### Copyright to Munch’s Writings and Letters
The copyright to Munch’s writings and letters expired 1 January 2015, 70 years after Munch’s death. Munch’s writings and letters have therefore legally passed into the public domain.

### Copyright to Letters Addressed to Munch
In Norway the authors of private letters have copyright to their letters for 70 years. After that, the copyright expires and the letters pass into the public domain. All letters addressed to Munch that are published in the digital archive are either in the public domain or the question of copyright has been agreed upon with the author or the author’s heirs.

In cases where the copyright has not expired, the reproduction of the objects, other than for private, non-commercial use is not permitted without a written agreement with the proprietor of the objects as well as with the proprietor of the copyright to the objects.

### The Physical Objects. Proprietorship
Munch’s writings are chiefly owned by the Munchmuseet, but also by a number of other institutions and private persons. The letters addressed to Munch that are published in this repository all belong to the Munch collection owned by Munchmuseet. Aside from private non-commercial use, none of the archive objects may be reproduced without a written agreement with the proprietor of the objects.

### Transcriptions of Munch's Writings and Letters Addressed to Munch
Munchmuseet owns the copyright to the transcriptions of Munch's written texts. Aside from private, non-commercial use no part of the transcriptions may be reproduced without a written agreement with the museum.

### Translations of Munch’s Writings
Copyright to the translations belongs to Munchmuseet and the translator. Aside from private non-commercial use, no part of the translations may be reproduced without a written agreement with Munchmuseet and the translator.

### Regarding translation
Munchmuseet requires that all translations be based on Munch's original Norwegian texts and does not allow translations from translations.

### All other Texts
Where nothing else is explicitly stated, all other texts published in this repository are produced by or for Munchmuseet. Copyright to these texts is held by Munchmuseet and the authors (or translators). Aside from private non-commercial use no part of the texts may be reproduced without a written agreement with Munchmuseet and the author (or translator).
